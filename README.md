# Project description

I built and trained a dense neural network on 15K animal profiles, each with 23 features, to predict adoption speed with an accuracy of 86%. We hope this model can help shelters improve pet profiles for faster adoptions and provide a numeric evaluation while developing online profiles for pets.
