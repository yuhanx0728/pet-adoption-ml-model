# Modeling Pet Adoption Prediction

Real world data is often unclean, noisy, incomplete and imbalanced. These problems can be overcome by using specific mathematical techniques discussed in the paper. Here, we train a dense neural network on 15K online profile data of pets in animal shelters, each with 23 features, to predict adoption speed. This allows us to gain some key insights into how to advertise pets as well as provide a numeric evaluation while developing online profiles for pets, with an accuracy of 86%. This model can help shelters improve pet profiles for faster adoptions.
